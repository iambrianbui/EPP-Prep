Brian Bui 890670979

This program will create an interactive program for an urgent care clinic.
A patient's record contains the following:
	ID Firstname Lastname Age Email
		(i.e.)	0 Brian Bui 19 iambrianbui@csu.fullerton.edu
				int	string	string	int	string
There will be two queues available:
	(1)  Urgent Care
		•	These patients have the highest priority.
	(2)  Regular Care
		•	These patients have secondary priority.
It is to be noted that text file and the queues have no relation to eachother.

There are 6 choices in the menu:
	(1)  New Patient
		•	This will create a new patient, prompting the user for:
				ID Firstname Lastname Age Email
			then, it will ask the user on which waitlist they are to be on.

	(2)  Returning Patient
		•	This will find the given ID and retrieve the information at hand.
			If the ID is not found a message will inform the user.  If the ID
			is found, the user will be asked on which waitlist they are to be on.

	(3)  Doctor Consultation
		•	This will pop the queue on the urgent waitlist or the regular waitlist 
			respectively.

	(4)  Find Patient
		•	This will find information about a patient given the ID.  If they
			cannot be found, a message will inform the user.

	(5)  Delete Patient
		•	This will delete patient information from the main system given the ID.
			If they cannot be found, a message will inform the user.  

	(6)  Quit
		•	This will exit the program, GIVEN THAT THERE ARE NO MORE MEMBERS IN THE 
			URGENT LIST!!!!!!
			
			If there are still members in the urgent waitlist, the program will go
			back to the menu.  Otherwise, it will print the remaining regular wait
			list information, overwriting all patient information to "Patient.txt".

There will be 3 headers and 1 main code.
	(1)  Queue for the lists  (header)
	(2)  Program/Classes  (header)
	(3)  Main/Menu  (main)
